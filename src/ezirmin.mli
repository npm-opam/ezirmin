module type Repo = sig

  (** {1 Repo operations} *)

  (** [Repo] provides operations on repositories. *)

  type repo
  (** The type of repository handles. A repository contains a set of branches. *)

  type branch
  (** The type of persistent branches. *)

  val init : ?root:string -> ?bare:bool -> unit -> repo Lwt.t
  (** Initialize and connect to the repository in a backend specific manner.

      {ul
      {- [root] is the local git repository's root directory. If unset, the
      current working directory is chosen to be the root.}
      {- If [bare] is set (unset by default), the git repository is made to be
      bare. Otherwise, the contents are expanded into the local filesystem on
      each update. This can cause performance issues on write heavy workloads.}
      } *)

  val master : repo -> branch Lwt.t
  (** [master repo] fetches the master branch of the repository. *)

  val get_branch : repo -> branch_name:string -> branch Lwt.t
  (** [get_branch repo b] fetches the branch [b] by name. If branch [b] does not
      already exist, then the branch will be created and a handle to it
      returned. *)

  val get_branch_name : branch -> string option Lwt.t
  (** Return the branch name. Return [None] if the branch is not persistent. *)

  val clone_force : branch -> string -> branch Lwt.t
  (** [clone_force b n] clones the branch [b] naming the new branch [n]. If a
      branch named [n] exists, then that branch will be overwritten. *)

  val merge : branch -> into:branch -> unit Lwt.t
  (** [merge w m] merges branch [w] into [m]. Merge will always succeed. After
      the merge the branch [w] continues to exist. *)

  val install_listener : unit -> unit
  (** Create a thread that actively polls for change. Prefer
      {{:https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/inotify/inotify.2.0/}inotify} if it
      works on your system. *)
end

(** {2 Mergeable datastructures} *)

module type Blob_log = sig
  (** {1 An append-only log} *)

  (** [Blob_log] provides mergeable append-only logs. Appending to log is a
      [O(n)] operation, where [n] is the size of the size of the log. For an
      efficient implementation see, {!Log}. *)

  include Repo

  type elt
  (** The type of value stored in the log. *)

  (** [append b p e] appends a log message [e] to the log at path [p] in branch
      [b]. *)

  val read_all : branch -> path:string list -> elt list Lwt.t
  (** [read_all b p] returns the list of messages in the log at path [b] in
      branch [b]. *)

  val watch : branch -> path:string list -> (elt -> unit Lwt.t) -> (unit -> unit Lwt.t) Lwt.t
  (** [watch b p cb] watches the log at the path [p] in the branch [b]. On each
      append of a message [m] to the log, the callback function [cb m] is
      invoked. Before installing watches, a listener thread must be started
      with {!Repo.install_listener} that watches the store for changes.
      @return a function to disable the watch. *)
end

module type Log = sig

  (** {1 An efficient write-optimized append-only logs} *)

  (** [Log] provides mergeable append-only logs with support for paginated
      reads. Appending messages to logs and merging two logs are constant time
      operations. Logs can be read in reverse chronological order. Logs also
      provide support for paginated reads. *)

  include Repo

  type elt
  (** The type of value stored in the log. *)

  type cursor
  (** The type of cursor. The cursor is an abstraction that represents a specifc
      position in the log. *)

  val append : branch -> path:string list -> elt -> unit Lwt.t
  (** [append b p m] appends the message [m] to the log at path [b] in the
      branch [b]. Append is an O(1) operation. *)

  val get_cursor : branch -> path:string list -> cursor option Lwt.t
  (** [get_cursor b p] fetches the cursor that points to the latest message in
      in the log at path [p] in the branch [b]. If the log at path [p] is empty,
      then the operation returns [None]. *)

  val read : cursor -> num_items:int -> (elt list * cursor option) Lwt.t
  (** [read c n] reads the next [n] messages in reverse chronological order at
      the cursor. The operation returns the list of messages read and an
      optional cursor value that represents the tail of the last message read.
      The cursor can then be used to read subsequent messages.

      If the number of requested message is greater than the number of available
      messages in the log, then the operation returns the available messages and
      [None] for the cursor. *)

  val read_all : branch -> path:string list -> elt list Lwt.t
  (** [read_all b p] reads all the messages in the log at path [p] in the branch
      [b] in reverse chronological order. *)

  (** {2 Watch} *)

  val watch : branch -> path:string list -> (elt -> unit Lwt.t) -> (unit -> unit Lwt.t) Lwt.t
  (** [watch b p cb] watches the log at the path [p] in the branch [b]. On each
      append of a message [m] to the log, the callback function [cb m] is
      invoked. Before installing watches, a listener thread must be started
      with {!Repo.install_listener} that watches the store for changes.
      @return a function to disable the watch. *)
end

module type Lww_register = sig

  (** {1 Last-write-wins register} *)

  (** [Lww_register] provides registers that can be read and written to. In
      case of conflicting writes, the latest write wins. *)

  include Repo

  type value
  (** The type of content stored in the register. *)

  val read : branch -> path:string list -> value option Lwt.t
  (** [read b p] fetches the value of the register at path [b] in the branch
      [b]. If the register had not been previously written to, then the
      operation returns [None]. *)

  val write : branch -> path:string list -> value -> unit Lwt.t
  (** [write b p v] updates the value of the register at path [b] in branch [b]
      to [v]. *)

  val watch : branch -> path:string list
              -> ([ `Added of value | `Removed of value | `Updated of value * value ] -> unit Lwt.t)
              -> (unit -> unit Lwt.t) Lwt.t
  (** [watch b p cb] watches the register at path [p] in the branch [b], where
      [cb] is the callback function.

module type Queue = sig

  (** {1 Mergeable Queue} *)

  include Repo

  type elt
  (** The type of element in the queue. *)

  (** Create a new queue. If a queue already exists at this path, then this
      operation overwrites the old queue. *)

  val length : branch -> path:string list -> int Lwt.t
  (** Return the length of the queue. If the queue does not exist, then [0] is
      returned. *)

  val is_empty : branch -> path:string list -> bool Lwt.t
  (** Returns [true] if the queue is empty. If the queue does not exist, then
      return [true]. *)

  val push : branch -> path:string list -> elt -> unit Lwt.t
  (** [push b p e] pushes element [e] to the back of the queue at path [p] in
      branch [b]. If the queue does not exist at this path, then an empty queue
      is created and [e] is pushed to the back of this queue. *)

  val pop_exn : branch -> path:string list -> elt Lwt.t
  (** Pop an element from the front of the queue. If the queue is empty or does
      not exist at this path, then exception [Empty] is raised. *)

  val pop : branch -> path:string list -> elt option Lwt.t
  (** Pop an element from the front of the queue. If the queue is empty of does
      not exist at this path, then [None] is returned. *)

  val to_list : branch -> path:string list -> elt list Lwt.t
  (** Return a list with the elements in the queue. *)

  (** {2 Iteration} *)

  type cursor
  (** The type of cursor. *)

      not exist, return [None]. *)

  val next_exn : cursor -> (elt * cursor) Lwt.t
  (** Get the next element in the queue. Return a pair of the head element and a
      cursor that points to the tail of the queue. Raise [Empty] if the cursor
      points to an empty queue. *)

  val next : cursor -> (elt * cursor) option Lwt.t
  (** Get the next element in the queue. Return a pair of the head element and a
      cursor that points to the tail of the queue. Return [None] if the cursor
      points to an empty queue. *)

  val iter : branch -> path:string list -> f:(elt -> unit) -> unit Lwt.t
  (** [iter b p f] applies f on each element of the queue from the front to the
      back of the queue. *)

              -> (unit -> unit Lwt.t) Lwt.t
  (** [watch b p cb] watches the queue at path [p] in branch [b], and invokes
